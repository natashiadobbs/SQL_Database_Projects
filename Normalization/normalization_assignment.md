# Normalization Assignment

This assignment showcases my ability to clean and restructure unorganized data into a fully normalized database.

## 📌 What I Did:
- Applied normalization steps: UNF → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF
- Removed duplicate and dependent data across attributes
- Created multiple sub-entity tables for clean relational design
- Identified functional dependencies and keys
- Explained the full process in a clearly labeled PDF
