# Scenario-Based Data Modeling

This project applies normalization techniques to real-world business scenarios provided in test cases.

## 📌 What I Did:
- Translated raw scenario data into relational database tables
- Normalized from Un-Normalized Form (UNF) to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF
- Created clear sub-tables for Students, Courses, Instructors, and Enrollment
- Documented primary and foreign keys
- Included SQLFiddle implementation links inside the Excel workbook

📁 File included: `Scenario_3_INFM312.xlsx`
