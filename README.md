# SQL Database Design Projects

This repository showcases my SQL and database design work completed in the Database Design and Data Processing course. It includes SQL code for relational database creation, normalization from UNF to 3NF, and scenario-based modeling using real-world business cases. Projects demonstrate my ability to structure relational data, write clean SQL, and translate business requirements into scalable table designs.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. Bookstore SQL Project  
**Folder:** `sql-code/`  
- Built a bookstore database using MySQL syntax  
- Designed tables for books, authors, customers, and sales  
- Implemented foreign key constraints with `ON DELETE CASCADE`  
- Inserted sample data and wrote queries for:
  - Retrieving books and prices
  - Sales by customer
  - Total quantity and revenue per book
- **Live demo:** [SQLFiddle Link](https://sqlfiddle.com/mysql/online-compiler?id=1c3528fa-cc16-4e5f-a5ae-36546543d332)

### 2. Scenario-Based Data Modeling  
**Folder:** `scenarios/`  
- Modeled test case tables from unstructured business scenarios  
- Applied normalization concepts to structure entities like Students, Courses, Instructors, and Enrollment  
- Used Excel to document Un-Normalized Form (UNF), 1NF, and 3NF stages  
- Created separate worksheets for each sub-entity with clearly defined primary and foreign keys  
- Embedded SQLFiddle links to show SQL implementation of normalized designs

### 3. Normalization Assignment  
**Folder:** `normalization/`  
- Demonstrated full normalization process from UNF ‚Üí 1NF ‚Üí 2NF ‚Üí 3NF  
- Identified and removed repeating groups, partial dependencies, and transitive dependencies  
- Created relational tables for authors, books, borrowers, and borrowing details  
- Explained normalization steps clearly within an Excel workbook

## üìå About This Portfolio

This collection of SQL projects reflects my foundational skills in database design, data structuring, and writing production-ready SQL code. These assignments prepared me to approach real-world data modeling problems in health informatics and beyond.
